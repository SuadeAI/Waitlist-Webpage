            <p>
              I am a compsci + physics student at the uofa and a visiting student at stanford. 
              I have an unusual obsession towards startups and hypersonic airplanes. 
              I LOVE meeting people who are a little nuts and think outside the box. so if you wanna talk to me about startups, 
              technology, books, life, anything, ANYTHING -- reach out :))

              Hey there, my name is Galileo Kim. I am currently a highschooler who loves taking on a good challenge. 
              You can often find me working out at the gym, hanging out with friends, or listening to some good music. 
              If I could be anywhere in the world at this moment, I would either be hiking high up in the mountains or swimming low down in the ocean, 
              but sitting at my computer working on Suade is an awesome inbetween for now. Feel free to hit me up!

              I'm a comp sci student and member of zing.ai (I'm the guy that
              made this website lol). That's all cool but what I really wanna
              tell you is that I REALLY LOVE MUSIC. And I don't have enough
              friends who I can talk to about that. So like, if you're a fan of
              Radiohead or Charli XCX or Outkast or any other cool artists,
              please do hit me up! But also about the app we're working on. But
              like, music....

              Hey there! I'm UofA compsci and math student. I'm really excited to develop this app. 
              I've always wanted to build a startup since when I was in high school. Don't judge me, 
              but I like K-pop. My fav group is New Jeans, Nmixx, Aespa, Le sserafim and many more!
              I am also going to the gym daily. So if we have the same interest HMU!

              Hello! I am a high school student at Harry Ainlay with many goals in life.
              For instance, traveling the world, free burritos from Bar Burrito 
              for life, and, oh yeah, building a tech startup! When I am not in the mood to be overly
              productive, you'll catch me playing videogames and binging multiple seasons 
              of anime (Bleach is one of my favourites).
