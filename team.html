              I am a compsci + physics student at the uofa and a visiting student at stanford. 
              I have an unusual obsession towards startups and hypersonic airplanes. 
              I LOVE meeting people who are a little nuts and think outside the box. so if you wanna talk to me about startups, 
              technology, books, life, anything, ANYTHING -- reach out :))

              I'm a comp sci student and member of zing.ai (I'm the guy that
              made this website lol). That's all cool but what I really wanna
              tell you is that I REALLY LOVE MUSIC. And I don't have enough
              friends who I can talk to about that. So like, if you're a fan of
              Radiohead or Charli XCX or Outkast or any other cool artists,
              please do hit me up! But also about the app we're working on. But
              like, music....

              Hey there! I'm UofA compsci and math student. I'm really excited to develope this app.

              but I like K-pop. My fav group is New Jeans, Nmixx, Aespa, Le sserafim and many more!

              Hello! I am a high school student at Harry Ainlay with many goals in life.
              For instance, traveling the world, free burritos from Bar Burrito 
              for life, and, oh yeah, building a tech startup! When I am not in the mood to be overly
              productive, you'll catch me playing videogames and binging multiple seasons 
              of anime (Bleach is one of my favourites).
