        zing.ai is an app built by a small team of high school and university
        students set out to build a better way to connect with people.ðŸ«‚

        AI is not restricted to chatbots. LLMs are also excellent matchmakers.
      </p>
      <p>Imagine the thrill of Omegle mixed with the intelligence of the latest and
        greatest AI. This means you will be able to meet new people with
        confidence that your conversations won't amount to just "Sooo... what's
        your major I guess?"

          <li>our aim is to make a social AI. one that understands humans deeply and can help us build the future.</li>
          <li>we don't want to bombard you with validation. just want you to have fun.</li>
        </ol>
