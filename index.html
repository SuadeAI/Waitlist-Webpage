        <p>
          zing.ai is an app built by a small team of high school and university
          students who want to offer a better way to connect with people. Think
          of the thrill of Omegle mixed with the intelligence of the latest and
          greatest AI. This means you will be able to meet new people with
          confidence that your conversations won't amount to just "Sooo...
          what's your major I guess?"
