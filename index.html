      <!-- Brief, funny description of what we do and what are future plans are -->
      <!-- <h2>A spark of connection</h2> -->
      <p>
        SuadeAI is an app built by a small team of high school and university
        students set out to build a better way to connect with people.ðŸ«‚
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you ever:
        <ol>
          <li>Feel low and stressed out about your courses and REALLY wished there was a senior you could talk to?</li>
          <li>Wish to get into research and talk to professors but don't know how to reach out?</li>
          <li>Feel left out with what's happening across campus and wanna stay up-to-date?</li>
          <li>Found it difficult to meet more awesome people like you?</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>We were in the same boat.</p>
      <p>
        TLDR; AI is not restricted to chatbots. LLMs are also excellent matchmakers.
      </p>
      <p>Imagine Linkedin and Twitter mixed with the intelligence of the latest and
        greatest AI. This means you will be able to meet new people with
        confidence that your conversations won't amount to just "Sooo... what's
        your major I guess?"
      </p>
      <p>We are building a social network with an LLM interface. Basically, Suade makes it 
        easier for students to find professors, research opportunities, friends, and courses 
        using a single prompt. No more searching the school directory and discord servers for hours.</p>
      <!-- goals/beliefs -->
      <h3>
        We have 3 very simple goals/beliefs.
      </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Building a non-cringe, unstructured way of meeting new people.</li>
          <li>Make a social AI. One that understands humans deeply and can help us build the future.</li>
          <li>We don't want to bombard you with validation. just want you to have fun.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><u>Our version 1 is out now for iOS.</u> V1 helps you find professors/research opportunities at your university using a simple prompt. </p>
